How many founders are in your team?

* 1


How many founders in your team identify as women, men and/or non-binary?

* Men - 1


Where is your company based (town/city and country)?

* Aberystwyth, UK - I'm seeking to move permanently to the UK from the US


Which impact theme most closely matches your company?

* Healthy Lives & An Inclusive Society (for disabled and elderly)


Does your product or service improve the working lives of people on low-pay or in insecure employment?

* Yes especially people who are elderly and their carers.


What social or environmental problem are you trying to solve?

* People who are elderly are at high risk for many issues, including disabilty problems (e.g. vision difficulty and cognitive difficulty), medical problems (such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease), and social problems (e.g. isolation and exclusion). 


Why did you pick this problem to work on?

* I picked this problem because my parents are dying and have Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and I want to help them connect better with family, friends, and carers.

Who are your target users, and what have you learnt about their specific needs from talking to them?

* 1. People who need ongoing care, such as people who are elderly and/or disabled. Their needs are diverse. I've learned that many of their needs coalesce into one overarching need: much-simpler video calling.

* 2. Carers, including those who work in care homes. Their needs are to support the carees, and this includes helping with familial needs, medical needs, social needs, and more.


Tell us more about your target audience and detail whether they are from disadvantaged or underserved communities.

* People who are eldelry and disabled are facing extreme exclusion from society as a whole, and especially from mainstream digital technology.


What tech for good product or service are you building and how does it solve that problem?

* BoldContacts makes video calling simple, especially for people who are elderly, people who are disabled, and people who are carers.


Explain how your product will work. Be concise.

* BoldContacts is a simple mobile app. It's like FaceTime plus much easier to use.


Who are your competitors? What differentiates you from them?

* For video calling: Apple Facetime, Google Meet, Zoom. BoldContacts differentiates by being much simpler and much more accessible, especially for people who are elderly and disabled.

* For elderly care: GoGoGrandparent, GrandPad. IMHO two great companies that are directly focused on the same target audience. BoldContacts differentiates by being much more similar to what users already know e.g. the user's own iPhone and Facetime.


How will you know that your technology has achieved a positive impact? 

* BoldContacts helps families keep connected. It helps people get better care. It helps carers support their carees.


Specify which impact outcomes you hope to achieve in the future and how you plan to measure them. 

* One year roadmap: 1. Create carer-institution multi-user capability, so a care home can use it with many residents. 2. Create Android version, so many more worldwide users can use it on commodity tablets. 3. Initiate research partnerships with UK NHS and UK academia for providing large-scale population-wide deployments.


How do you think you can scale your product or service to benefit millions of lives and/or protect the planet?

* BoldContacts is available for free, and is translated into many human languages.


How do you think your idea will make money?

* By saving money on healthcare costs.


How big is the market and what's the size of the market your team is targeting.

* The market is everyone who gets elderly. To start, we are focusing on the UK elderly because of the widespread urgent society need, and because we are getting excellent feedback so far from UK NHS employees that this can help, and can be especially easy to try.


Tell us more about your revenue model. What have you done to test and validate customers and/or users willingness to pay?

* The revenue model is charging for add-on services. This is essentially in-app purchasing. Testing and validation works great with ad hoc human helpers (e.g. Paul Graham's "Do things that don't scale", and Zappos early testing).


What stage of development are you at? 

* Live with early free/trial users


How have you validated your tech and/or product so far?

* 1. Real use by real users, with ongoing iteration. A key finding is the need for an accessory catalog, such as for easy-grip device cases, easy-access wheelchair attachments, and easier ways to add contacts.

* 2. Showcases to relevant experts in UK NHS (e.g. emergency department RN) , UK academia (e.g. psychology disability professor), UK business owners (e.g. content provider bookstore founder), etc. Relevant quotations of support are on the website.


Please show us what you have built so far.

Team

* Full time just me. I have a group of 10+ advisors providing feedback and ready to help more if this application is approved.


Why are you the right team to address this problem?

* 1. My family has five parents who need this, so my need is urgent and deeply personal.

* 2. I have two decades of experience with San Francisco Bay Area startups, including with companies by Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, 500 Startups, and the like.

* 3. The UK NHS saved my life, and I saw firsthand the crushing problems of the doctors who are overwhelmed and the patients who are cut off from their families and carers.


Who in your team is committed to working full-time on the business to make it a success? 

* So far just me.


What percentage of the company does/will each member of the team own? 

* Equal.


How do you think BGV’s investment and programme can help your business?

* 1. I want the coaching. I know that BGV has many connections in the UK and EU, and also has the special distinction of social good. 

* 2. I want to be able to approach the UK NHS, UK academic institutions, and UK Home Office, and I believe that BGV can be a significant help toward all of these.

* 3. I'm seeking six months of salary to work on this.


Tell us why the programme and BGV as an investor is the right fit for you and your team. What current challenges are you facing in launching and growing your tech for good business? What encouraged you to apply for BGV?

* TODO


Have you already set up a company for your tech for good business? 

* No. I'm specifically waiting to do this until BGV advises on the ways forward.


Have you raised any investment or capital for this company?

* No.


Did you use AI to answer any part of this application? 

* No.


How did you hear about BGV?

* BGV website

* UK Home Office


Is everyone in the team who will be attending the programme legally allowed to work in the UK?

* Not yet. I am a US citizen and I hope to move to the UK via a UK Global Talent Visa.


Are you happy to provide us with more diversity and inclusion data after submitting your application?

* Yes.

We’d like to send the founders in your team a Diversity and Inclusion Questionnaire after you submit your application. Results from the questionnaire are all anonymised and will not be taken into account for the selection process for the programme.

* Yes.
