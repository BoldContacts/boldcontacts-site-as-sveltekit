    <h1>Skill space</h1>
        
    Purpose: Provide a physical place that is accessible to people who are elderly, people who are disabled, and their carers, where the people can get hands-on help with new skills.

    BoldContacts is one skill of many that can be shared in the skill space. We have volunteers who are interested in helping with many more kinds of skills, for people of all ages and abilities.

        <li>3D Printing: learn how to use a 3D printer, and the software to design and build 3D physical items.</li>

        <li>Aerospace engineering: learn how to build and fly paper airplanes, using the same ideas as with real aircraft.</li>

        <li>Artwork printmaking: learn how to create a greeting card, including the artwork and the physical cards.</li>

        <li>Discuss the project with the appropriate local council representatives. [IN PROGRES]</li>

        <li>Incorporate as a charity-- this requires UK Global Talent Visa authorization E.t.a. June 2023.</li>

        <li>Secure the building, equipment, volunteer commitments, and social marketing setups. E.t.a. July 2023.</li>

        <li>Offer the space and skill shares to a hand-selected group of testers, to gain feedback. E.t.a. August 2023.</li>
