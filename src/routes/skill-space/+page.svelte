    <h1>Skill space</h1>
        
    <p>Purpose: Provide a physical place that is accessible to people who are elderly, people who are disabled, and their carers, where the people can get hands-on help with new skills.</p>

    <p>BoldContacts is one skill of many that can be shared in the skill space. We have volunteers who are interested in helping with many more kinds of skills, for people of all ages and abilities.</p>

    <ul>
    
        <li>3D Printing: learn how to use a 3D printer, and the software to design and build 3D physical items.</li>

        <li>Aerospace engineering: learn how to build and fly paper airplanes, using the same ideas as with real aircraft.</li>

        <li>Artwork printmaking: learn how to create a greeting card, including the artwork and the physical cards.</li>

        <li>Herbal treatments: learn how to use herbs and tinctures to improve your well-being and your happiness.</li>
        
        <li>Chess for fun: learn the basics of the game, the moves, and why chess is so much fun.</li>

        <li>Creative writing: learn how to write a poem, short story, or novel; includes practice reading your work.</li>

        <li>Mental health coaching: learn about resources in the community and online that may help you and your loved ones.</li>
        
        <li>Phone skills for beginners: learn how to use your iPhone or Android phone for typical mobile applications.</li>

        <li>Therapy at home: learn relaxation techniques that can reduce anxiety, improve mood, and open communication.</li>

    </ul>
