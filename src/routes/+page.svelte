<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boldcontacts/id6443335501">BoldContacts on Apple App Store is now free!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/">BoldContacts on Google Play is coming soon.</a>


<h2>What is BoldContacts?</h2>

<p>BoldContacts™ is a mobile app to help you browse your contacts and connect with them.</p>

<p>BoldContacts is especially good for people who may be experiencing vision disabilities, or cognitive disabilities, or motor disabilities. The app displays each contact with a large photo (if available), large font, and large buttons.</p>
 
<p>BoldContacts started because our family members have recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and are now unable to use the typical contacts app. The app may also help people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Muscular Distrophy (MD), and more.</p>

<p>BoldContacts helps our family keep in touch, and helps caretakers connect with us. We hope it may help you and your loved ones. We welcome constructive feedback. We are actively seeking donations and grants to work on accessibility software full time. Contact Joel Parker Henderson at <a href="mailto:joel@joelparkerhenderson.com">joel@joelparkerhenderson.com</a><p></p>


<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The app shows each contact's name, photo (if available), and big bold icon buttons.</p>

<ul>

<li>A phone icon button that means "contact this person now". This button connects you by using your choice of video, or phone, or email, or message, or custom URL. A caregiver can customize this by using the default iOS Contacts app.</li>

<li>A left-arrow icon button that mean "show the previous contact", and a right-arrow icon button that means "show the next contact". These icon buttons help you navigate backward/forward through the list of contacts.</li>

</ul>

<p>The buttons are purposefully far apart, to help people see them better, and to help people be able to tap each button separately.</p>

<p>The app saves brief anonymous usage data in your "Documents" directory in a file named "BoldContacts.txt". The data is for diagnostics and disability assistance.</p>


<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>The first time you launch BoldContats, you will see an Apple iOS prompt that asks for you to approve this access.</p>

<p>Say yes.</p>


<h2>Personalization</h2>

<p>You can personalize how your BoldContacts app will connect to your contact:

<ol>
    
<li>Launch your typical Apple Contacts app, and edit the contact.</li>

<li>Create a new contact field i.e. phone number, or email address, or URL address.</li>

<li>Edit the new contact field label to be "BoldContacts".</li>

</ol>
