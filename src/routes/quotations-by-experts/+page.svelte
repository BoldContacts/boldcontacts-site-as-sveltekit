<h1>Quotations by experts</h1>

<p>Thank you so much for discussing BoldContacts and my UK Global Talent Visa.</p>

<p>I'm asking quotations by experts that highlight their initiatives.</p>

<p>Purpose:</p>

<ol>

    <li>Quotations by experts inform readers about the importance of elderly care work, and that the sector needs people who want to help.</li>

    <li>Quotations by experts teach people a bit about the breadth and scope of current initiatives, which can inspire people to learn more.</li>

    <li>Quotations by experts are for supplementary support in my UK Global Talent Visa application. The quotation is informal and friendly; it is not any kind of formal endorsement, nor official letter of recommendation, nor financial commitment, etc.</li>

<h2>Health Innovation Service</h2>

<blockquote><p>"Care City is a health innovation service based in North East London, and trialling new health innovations across the UK. We were are part of the NHS Testbed. One of our recent projects is working on a dementia wayfinding app to help those with dementia to be able to navigate independently using an app and AR (Augmented Reality).</p><p>We would really like to work with someone as experienced as Joel to get his insights on ensuring the user interface is as simple as possible for this vulnerable customer group. He has already developed an app to support dementia users make video calls in a very simple and clear dementia-friendly way. We would also really like to work with him to develop this product so it can be used freely by social care providers to allow more isolated people in care homes to talk to their relatives who may be around the world."</p></blockquote>

<h2>University</h2>

<blockquote><p>"My research over the past 25 years involves examining how older people stay connected to the world around them. In our fast evolving technocentric society, there is significant and pressing need to make sure older people can fully engage with the world around them using technology, enhancing their connectivity with other people and the things they need to do.</p><p>Talking with Joel about his product BoldContacts fits this need perfectly, making technology simple for older people to use so they can stay connected and get their needs met. There is nothing else out there that meets this need in such a simple and effective way."</p></blockquote>

<h2>Hospital</h2>

<blockquote><p>"I'm a Sister in NHS A&E. I work with critically ill patients and deal with emergencies every day. My hospital has elderly patients who need to stay for longer durations, even weeks, in Clinical Decisions Unit (CDU) and other wards.</p><p>I know Joel. I have talked with him about his BoldContacts project and the innovation of helping these patients by giving them better access to video calling. I hope you admit him to the UK."</p></blockquote>
- <cite>Laura Hackett, Hywel Dda Health Board, Bronglais Hospital</cite>


<h2>Mental Health Advocate</h2>

<blockquote><p>"I’m a mental health advocate in Wales and I work to raise awareness of the importance of mental health across the UK. I’ve been interviewed by the BBC a number of times on various mental health topics. I have also taken part in a number of discussions and given speeches at national events, contributed to podcasts and written articles based on my experiences.</p><p>I believe Joel and BoldContacts will be beneficial to our country."</p></blockquote>
