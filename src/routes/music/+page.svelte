<h2>How to link to music</h2>

<p>Many major music services have ways to link directly to an artist, or album, or song, or video, or playlist.</p>

<p>The link is called a "URL" which stands for "Uniform Resource Locator". The link functions as a web address.</p>

<p>Let's use an example of The Beatles song "I Want To Hold Your Hand".</p>

<p>Each music service has its own way link to music by using a URL. You will need to use whichever way your preferred service uses.</p>

<p>Example URL formats:</p>

<ul>

    <li>
        <b>YouTube Music:</b>
        <br>
        <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=v1HDt1tknTc">https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=v1HDt1tknTc</a>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Spotify Music:</b>
        <br>
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4pbG9SUmWIvsROVLF0zF9s">https://open.spotify.com/track/4pbG9SUmWIvsROVLF0zF9s</a>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Apple Music:</b>
        <br>
        <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-want-to-hold-your-hand/1440833098?i=1440833542">https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-want-to-hold-your-hand/1440833098?i=1440833542</a>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>How to create a contact</h2>

<p>When you know the URL link to the music you want, then you can create a new contact:</p>

<ol>

    <li>Start your typical iOS Contacts app.</li>

    <li>Tap the "+" icon to create a new contact.</li>

    <li>Type any name you want, such as "The Beatles".</li>

    <li>Upload any photo you want, such as a photo of the Beatles that you download from the internet.</li>

    <li>Add the URL link to your music.</li>

</ol>

Then quit BoldContacts and relaunch it; this tells BoldContacts to refresh your contact list, including your new contact. As an aside, a future release of BoldContacts will add automatic refresh.
