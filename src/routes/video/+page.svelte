<h2>How to link to a video</h2>

<p>Many major video services have ways to link directly to an artist, or album, or song, or video, or playlist.</p>

<p>The link is called a "URL" which stands for "Uniform Resource Locator". The link functions as a web address.</p>

<p>Let's use an example of video for "The Wizard of Oz".</p>

<p>Each video service has its own way link to video by using a URL. You will need to use whichever way your preferred service uses.</p>



<h2>How to create a contact</h2>

<p>When you know the URL link to the video you want, then you can create a new contact:</p>

<ol>

    <li>Start your typical iOS Contacts app.</li>

    <li>Tap the "+" icon to create a new contact.</li>

    <li>Type any name you want, such as "Wizard of Oz".</li>

    <li>Upload any photo you want, such as a photo of the video that you download from the internet.</li>

    <li>Add the URL link to your video.</li>

</ol>
