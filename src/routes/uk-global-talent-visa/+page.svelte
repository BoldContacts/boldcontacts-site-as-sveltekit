<h1>UK Global Talent Visa</h1>

<p>I'm Joel Parker Henderson, founder of BoldContacts. I'm applying for a United Kingdom Global Talent Visa. I'm asking many people for advice and help me, because my goal for the visa is to move to the UK and work on BoldContacts full time, all for free, all open source.</p>

<p>This is happening because my mother-in-law has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, my dad has been diagnosed with Parkinson's, and my friend has been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. I'm learning about how difficult these diseases are, and how I may be able to help a bit by using my programming skills.</p>

<p>The UK Global Talent Visa offers a way forward that enables to me to live in the UK full time, and volunteer with the UK NHS, which is the largest healthcare group in the western world.</p>

<p>I'm actively seeking advice and mentorship with this process. If you have suggestions, ideas, insights, or potential contacts, I will greatly appreciate connecting with you. My email address is joel@boldcontacts.org.</p>

<p>Best,<br>Joel</p>
